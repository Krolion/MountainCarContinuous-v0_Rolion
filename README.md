Training process consists of two parts: the car learning to go uphill (first 130 generations, Learning2.jpg) and the car learning to maximize score (last 2876 generations,  Learning.jpg). Every strategy consists of n parts, dependind on starting point. "Learning.jpg" shows maximal reached distance for different starting pointsfor first training part. "Learning2.jpg" shows maximal score for different starting points (two lines) and score for random starting point (orange dots) for second training part. "Car9.py" train strategy from scratch. "Car_video.py" uses "2876.txt" that contains trained strategy and create video of one try with random starting point. "Car_FP.py"  uses "2876.txt" and gives you maximal score out of 100 tries. "R97.1524.mp4" contains video of attempt with 97.1524 score.
